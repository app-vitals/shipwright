# Architecture

> How Shipwright Harness is structured: three sequenced artifacts (plugin → metrics → agent) plus supporting surfaces, all MIT, all local-first.

## Overview

Shipwright Harness is the open-source autonomous delivery agent for [Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code). It ships as three artifacts, built and sequenced **A → B → C**, each independently runnable and depending on **no external platform service**:

| Phase | Artifact | Directory | What it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A** | **Plugin** (the system) | `plugins/shipwright/` | The Claude Code plugin users `/plugin install` — commands, skills, agents, scripts for the full delivery loop. Repo-agnostic. |
| **B** | **Metrics dashboard** | `metrics/` | Hono service: JSON endpoints + a server-rendered dashboard over a backend-agnostic event-store interface (PostHog · Postgres · SQLite), with a PostHog-shaped `POST /batch/` ingest route. |
| **C** | **Shipwright agent** | `agent/` | Hono service + Prisma store; a thin autonomous runner: pick next ready task → build → ship PR → forward metrics. |

The hard architectural rule: **no new coupling.** The plugin stays repo-agnostic; the metrics service and the agent each stand alone. Everything runs offline by default (fixtures / injected doubles / scratch queue); live external calls happen only when an env var explicitly enables them.

## A — Plugin

The plugin drives the delivery loop: **spec → plan → execute → review → deploy**. It is repo-agnostic — it runs its commands against *any* repository, and this repo is both its source and a codebase it ships against.

Key surfaces (see `plugins/shipwright/README.md` and `plugins/shipwright/CLAUDE.md` for the full command/skill catalog):

- **Commands** (`commands/`) — `brainstorm`, `plan-session`, `dev-task`, `review`, `patch`, `deploy`, the five-phase test-readiness pipeline (`test-inventory` → `test-design` → `test-migration` → `test-roadmap` → `test-publish`), `metrics`, `research`, `research-docs`, and more.
- **Skills** (`skills/`) — autonomous behaviors including `ship-loop` (drains the task queue one pipeline step per call) and `shipwright-brand`.
- **Scripts** (`scripts/`) — the task-store adapters, `check-dev-task.ts`, and supporting tooling.
- **References** (`references/`) — schemas and recipes (`metrics-schema.md`, `task-store.md`, `doc-refresh-recipe.md`, `reviews-schema.md`, …).

The plugin is pure TypeScript with **no server, no database, and no external HTTP in production code** — only `unit` and `integration` test layers apply.

## B — Metrics dashboard

A Hono service that turns the pipeline's events into analytics. Five read-only JSON endpoints (`/metrics/summary|trends|features|queue|tokens`) plus a session-gated `/dashboard`, served over a backend-agnostic **`MetricsProvider`** seam: query intent is expressed as typed data and each provider renders it to its store's native query. Supported backends are all **event stores** — PostHog (HogQL, live today), SQLite (local, `POST /batch/` ingest live today), and Postgres (planned) — so results are identical across them. Prometheus is intentionally excluded (numeric time-series, not event-level). See **[metrics.md](./metrics.md)** and the design spec under `docs/superpowers/specs/`.

## C — Shipwright agent

A thin autonomous runner with a Prisma-backed store (SQLite locally, PostgreSQL in production) and three HTTP surfaces: a machine-polled **runtime API** (`/agents/:id/config`, `/agents/:id/crons`), a human-facing **admin CRUD API** (`/admin/api/agents/:id/...` for envs, crons, tools, tokens, plugins), and a server-rendered **admin UI** (`/admin/...` — login, agent list/detail, Slack provisioning). See **[agent.md](./agent.md)**.

> The container starts via `agent/src/entrypoint-main.ts` (Dockerfile `ENTRYPOINT`), which runs the full startup sequence (`entrypoint.ts`) and then spawns `run-agent.ts`. Implemented surfaces: the admin CRUD API, the admin UI, the runtime API, the Prisma store, the Slack event handler (`slack.ts`), and the cron runtime (`cron-handler.ts`).

## Supporting surfaces

| Surface | Directory | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Marketing site | `site/` | Astro + Tailwind (**shipwright-harness.com**). **Not** a Bun workspace; Playwright smoke tests (`*.spec.ts`). |
| Brand system | `brand/` | Locked design system (`BRAND.md`, `tokens.json`) + CSS build + lint, consumed by `site/`. |
| Local state | `state/` | Git-ignored JSON task-store fallback + cached review state (only written when the GitHub backend isn't active). |

## Workspace layout

The repo is a Bun-workspaces monorepo with **go-task** (`Taskfile.yml`) as the single local entrypoint. Three workspaces — `plugins/shipwright`, `metrics`, `agent` — are wired into the root `package.json`. The `site/` is intentionally excluded from the root `bun test` scan (its Playwright `*.spec.ts` files would crash Bun's runner).
